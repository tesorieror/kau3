		<p>The main task of the unit is to provide management and operational support by carrying out evaluations in relation to the King Abdulaziz University's
			goals and policies and by monitoring and analyzing the University's external environment. The purpose of this work is to lay the groundwork for the
			University Management's strategic decision making regarding the Academic standards systems and Higher Education Excellency.</p>

	<div class="col-xs-6">
		<p>The unit complements the planning and follow-up efforts carried out around the University, for higher education excellence, by providing in-depth
			analyses, thus contributing significantly to this quite resource-demanding type of work. We perform evaluations both at the request of the University's
			management and when we determine there is a need to predict and obtain the possible results of the current most important evaluation systems, to draw the
			actions KAU has to perform before the start of each year.</p>
